# Workflows Examples

A repository of example notebooks using the Workflows API.

Workflows offers some notebook-specific features (like interactive visualization on a map) that can't be shown easily with normal documentation. The [documentation](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/descarteslabs/workflows/readme.html) is still the place to go for API reference, high-level guides, and tutorials that don't revolve around notebook features, but this repository demonstrates what your day-to-day patterns of using Workflows in a notebook might look like.
